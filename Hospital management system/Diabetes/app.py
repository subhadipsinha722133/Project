🔸 **Gestational Diabetes**: Develops during pregnancy.

When you eat, your body breaks food down into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. Insulin helps glucose enter your cells to be used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it effectively."""
